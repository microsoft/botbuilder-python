# Custom Dialogs

Bot Framework v4 custom dialogs bot sample

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to sub-class the `Dialog` class to create different bot control mechanism like simple slot filling.

BotFramework provides a built-in base class called `Dialog`. By subclassing `Dialog`, developers can create new ways to define and control dialog flows used by the bot.

## Running the sample
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python.git
```
- Activate your desired virtual environment
- Bring up a terminal, navigate to `botbuilder-python\samples\19.custom-dialogs` folder
- In the terminal, type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- In the terminal, type `python app.py`

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Paste this URL in the emulator window - http://localhost:3978/api/messages

## Custom Dialogs

BotFramework provides a built-in base class called `Dialog`. By subclassing Dialog, developers
can create new ways to define and control dialog flows used by the bot. By adhering to the
features of this class, developers will create custom dialogs that can be used side-by-side
with other dialog types, as well as built-in or custom prompts.

This example demonstrates a custom Dialog class called `SlotFillingDialog`, which takes a
series of "slots" which define a value the bot needs to collect from the user, as well
as the prompt it should use. The bot will iterate through all of the slots until they are
all full, at which point the dialog completes.

# Multilingual Bot

Bot Framework v4 multilingual bot sample

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to translate incoming and outgoing text using a custom middleware and the [Microsoft Translator Text API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/).

## Concepts introduced in this sample

Translation Middleware: We create a translation middleware that can translate text from bot to user and from user to bot, allowing the creation of multi-lingual bots.

The middleware is driven by user state. This means that users can specify their language preference, and the middleware automatically will intercept messages back and forth and present them to the user in their preferred language.

Users can change their language preference anytime, and since this gets written to the user state, the middleware will read this state and instantly modify its behavior to honor the newly selected preferred language.

The [Microsoft Translator Text API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/), Microsoft Translator Text API is a cloud-based machine translation service. With this API you can translate text in near real-time from any app or service through a simple REST API call.
The API uses the most modern neural machine translation technology, as well as offering statistical machine translation technology.

## Running the sample
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python.git
```
- Activate your desired virtual environment
- Bring up a terminal, navigate to `botbuilder-python\samples\17.multilingual-bot` folder
- In the terminal, type `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- To consume the Microsoft Translator Text API, first obtain a key following the instructions in the [Microsoft Translator Text API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-text-how-to-signup). Paste the key in the `SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `SUBSCRIPTION_REGION` settings in the `config.py` file.

- In the terminal, type `python app.py`

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Paste this URL in the emulator window - http://localhost:3978/api/messages


### Creating a custom middleware

Translation Middleware: We create a translation middleware than can translate text from bot to user and from user to bot, allowing the creation of multilingual bots.
Users can specify their language preference, which is stored in the user state. The translation middleware translates to and from the user's preferred language.

### Microsoft Translator Text API

The [Microsoft Translator Text API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/), Microsoft Translator Text API is a cloud-based machine translation service. With this API you can translate text in near real-time from any app or service through a simple REST API call.
The API uses the most modern neural machine translation technology, as well as offering statistical machine translation technology.

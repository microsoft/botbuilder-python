Within the Bot Framework, the Bot Connector service enables your bot to exchange messages with users on channels that are configured in the Bot Framework Portal.

How to Install
==============

.. code-block:: python
  
  pip install botframework-connector

How to Use
==========

Authentication
==============

Your bot communicates with the Bot Connector service using HTTP over a secured channel (SSL/TLS). When your bot sends a request to the Connector service, it must include information that the Connector service can use to verify its identity.

To authenticate the requests, you'll need configure the Connector with the App ID and password that you obtained for your bot during registration and the Connector will handle the rest.

More information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-connector-authentication

Example
=======

Client creation (with authentication), conversation initialization and activity send to user.

.. code-block:: python

  from botbuilder.schema import *
  from botframework.connector import ConnectorClient
  from botframework.connector.auth import MicrosoftAppCredentials

  APP_ID = '<your-app-id>'
  APP_PASSWORD = '<your-app-password>'
  SERVICE_URL = 'https://slack.botframework.com'
  CHANNEL_ID = 'slack'
  BOT_ID = '<bot-id>'
  RECIPIENT_ID = '<user-id>'

  credentials = MicrosoftAppCredentials(APP_ID, APP_PASSWORD)
  connector = ConnectorClient(credentials, base_url=SERVICE_URL)

  conversation = connector.conversations.create_conversation(ConversationParameters(
              bot=ChannelAccount(id=BOT_ID),
              members=[ChannelAccount(id=RECIPIENT_ID)]))

  connector.conversations.send_to_conversation(conversation.id, Activity(
              type=ActivityTypes.message,
              channel_id=CHANNEL_ID,
              recipient=ChannelAccount(id=RECIPIENT_ID),
              from_property=ChannelAccount(id=BOT_ID),
              text='Hello World!'))

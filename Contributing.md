# Instructions for Contributing Code

## Contributing bug fixes and features

The Bot Framework team is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes and new 
features. Any submission must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has
 been approved by the Bot Framework team. Your pull request should include a link to 
 the bug that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a 
 comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

## Legal

License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission
 to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work
  being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request.

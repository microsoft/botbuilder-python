# ![Bot Framework SDK v4 Python](./doc/media/FrameWorkPython.png)

### [What's new with Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

This repository contains code for the Python version of the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. 

This SDK enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications using Python. SDKs for [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js), [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet) and [Java (preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) are also available.

To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Getting Started
To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

The [Bot Framework Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples) includes a rich set of samples repository.

If you want to debug an issue, would like to [contribute](#contributing), or understand how the Bot Builder SDK works, instructions for building and testing the SDK are below.

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Python "Virtual Environments" allow Python packages to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally, as such it is common practice to use them. Click [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) to learn more about creating _and activating_ Virtual Environments in Python. 

### Clone
Clone a copy of the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python.git
```
Change to the SDK's directory:
```bash
cd botbuilder-python
```

### Using the SDK locally

You will need the following 3 packages installed in your environment:
- [botframework-connector](https://pypi.org/project/botframework-connector/)
- [botbuilder-core](https://pypi.org/project/botbuilder-core/)
- [botbuilder-schema](https://pypi.org/project/botbuilder-schema/)

To use a local copy of the SDK you can link to these packages with the pip -e option. 

```bash
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-schema
pip install -e ./libraries/botframework-connector
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-core
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-integration-aiohttp
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-ai
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-applicationinsights
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-integration-applicationinsights-aiohttp
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-dialogs
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-azure
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-adapters-slack
pip install -e ./libraries/botbuilder-testing
```

### Running unit tests
First execute the following command from the root level of the repo:
```bash
pip install -r ./libraries/botframework-connector/tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r ./libraries/botbuilder-core/tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r ./libraries/botbuilder-ai/tests/requirements.txt
```

Then enter run pytest by simply typing it into your CLI:

```bash
pytest
```

This is the expected output:
```bash
============================= test session starts =============================
platform win32 -- Python 3.8.2, pytest-3.4.0, py-1.5.2, pluggy-0.6.0
rootdir: C:\projects\botbuilder-python, inifile:
plugins: cov-2.5.1
...
```

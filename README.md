This repository contains code for the Python version of the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder). The Bot Framework SDK v4 enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications using Python.  This Python version is GA and ready for production usage.

This repo is part the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework) - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

In addition to the Python SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages like [.Net SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js), and [Java](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java). 

To get started see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) for the v4 SDK.

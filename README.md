# Bot Builder SDK v4

This repository contains code for the Python version of the [Microsoft Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python).
The 4.x version of the SDK is being actively developed and should therefore be used for **EXPERIMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY**.

In addition to the .NET SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages:

- The [v4 JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js) has a high degree of parity with the .NET SDK 
  and lets you build rich bots using JavaScript for the Microsoft Bot Framework.
- The [Python Connector](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python) provides basic connectivity to the Microsoft Bot Framework 
  and lets developers build bots using Python. **v4 SDK coming soon**.
- The [Java Connector](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) provides basic connectivity to the Microsoft Bot Framework 
  and lets developers build bots using Java. **v4 SDK coming soon**.

To get started see the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python/wiki) for the v4 SDK.

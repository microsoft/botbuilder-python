# Bot Builder SDK v4

This repository contains code that provides basic connectivity to the Microsoft Bot Framework 
  and lets developers build bots using [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python). **v4 SDK coming soon**.
  
The 4.x version of the SDK is being actively developed and should therefore be used for **EXPERIMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY**.
Production bots should continue to be developed using the [v3 SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder).

In addition to the Python Connector, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages:
- The [v4 .NET SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet) has a high degree of parity with the JavaScript SDK 
  and lets you build rich bots using C# for the Microsoft Bot Framework.
- The [v4 JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js) has a high degree of parity with the .NET SDK 
  and lets you build rich bots using C# for the Microsoft Bot Framework.
- The [Java Connector](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) provides basic connectivity to the Microsoft Bot Framework 
  and lets developers build bots using Java. **v4 SDK coming soon**.

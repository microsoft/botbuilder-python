This repository contains code for the Python version of the [Microsoft Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder). The Bot Builder SDK v4 is the latest SDK for building bot applications. This Python version is in **Preview** state and is being actively developed. 

In addition to the Python SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages like [.Net SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js), and [Java](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java). Production bots should be developed using the JavaScript or .Net SDKs.

To get started see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) for the v4 SDK.

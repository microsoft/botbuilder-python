# Bot Builder SDK v4
This repository contains code for the Python version of the [Microsoft Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder). The 4.x version of the SDK is being actively developed and should therefore be used for **EXPERIMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY**.
In addition to the Python SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages like [.Net SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js), and [Java](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java).

To get started see the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python/wiki) for the v4 SDK.
